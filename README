== Stream

I wrote this a *while ago* so I could email items with attachments directly to my blog which I called a 'stream'.

I've sinced moved personal VPS hosts a few times and switched what I use for writing a few times.

However, I probably should have built/tacked-onto/hacked-into the functionality that I was missing.

As it turns out I'm now using Middleman which is just fantastic, however since it is of course a static site generator we don't get email to blog for free. I'm looking into it and was happy to see I have this code still in my projects folder.

Use what you'd like, the daemon/parser is at ./lib/ingest_stream_emails.rb

I apparently didn't abstract the handler for the emails theirselves, I may have been running my own mail server back then but don't recall how the hook worked
